### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University. I currently work at <a href="https://www.optml-group.com/">OPTML Group</a>, advised by <a href="https://lsjxjtu.github.io/">Prof. Sijia Liu</a>. I am interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My recent research focuses on scalable and trustworthy AI.

I received my B.E. in computer science from the <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences</a> (<a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/">Yao Class</a>, headed by <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/">Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</a>), Tsinghua University. I am fortunate to have been advised by <a href="https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm">Prof. Shi-Min Hu</a> on my undergrad research and bachelor thesis. In 2018, I had some wonderful times working with <a href="https://cdfg.mit.edu/wojciech">Prof. Wojciech Matusik</a> and <a href="https://yuanming.taichi.graphics/">Dr. Yuanming Hu</a> at MIT and with <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/">Prof. Kilian Weinberger</a> and <a href="https://www.gaohuang.net/">Prof. Gao Huang</a> at Cornell.

Before studying at MSU, I joined <a href="https://taichi.graphics/">Taichi Graphics, Inc.</a> as a start-up member in 2021. During my employment, I worked as a research engineer focused on developing <a href="https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi">Taichi Lang</a> and delving into differentiable physics.
